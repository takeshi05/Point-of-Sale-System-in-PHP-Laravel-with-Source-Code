Admin Panel
An administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage all the products, customers, and more. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, image, and other important details (codeastro.com). Just before anything else, this point-of-sale system project in Laravel does not have self-registration features for any users. Before moving further into the system, the admin has to first manage the products. For this, the user has to provide a number of details. Such as name, description, image, barcode number, price, and quantity. Later, the user has to set the product’s status before submitting it. Here, a product status simply refers to the state of being active or inactive. The users can only manage sales with active products.

Customer Management and Settings
After the management of products, the system user has to add up details for the customers. There are several details under a customer’s record. It includes the name of the customer along with their email address, contact number, address, and image/user avatar. The management of customer details plays an important role in maintaining the flow of point of sale. As each transaction requires a selection of existing customers. In fact, it’s kind of mandatory to have records of a number of customers in order to proceed with the pos system. Which is in fact the sales management side of the whole thing(codeastro.com). Besides, the system user can update a few settings for the system. The administrator can update the application name, description, currency, and warning quantity from the settings panel. Here, warning quantity gets triggered only when a product’s quantity reaches a certain mention point and indicates using red color.

Point of Sale POS System

And speaking of the pos system, both above-mentioned sections are equally important just before diving into these conclusions.

The administrator can simply click on any of the available products to select, enter the quantity and submit to the process. With these simple actions, the system also displays the total payable amount to the system users. Upon submitting the form, the user has to provide the total received amount. This whole POS system is based upon hand to hand cash payment system in which the user can only proceed once after receiving a certain amount. But, it can also rely upon other online transactions to proceed with.

Orders and More
On the other hand, the system displays all the transactions under the orders section after a successful sales transaction. The order list consists of various transaction details. Such as the name of the customer with the total amount, received amount, remaining amount, date, and payment status. Payment status refers to the state of payment being paid, pending, or unpaid(codeastro.com). Not just that, the order list section also supports filtering of data upon given dates. Besides everything, the system also calculates total income and today’s income that displays under the admin’s dashboard.
